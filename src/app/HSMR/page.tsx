        <p>
          Hospital standardized mortality ratio (HSMR) is an overall quality indicator that compares a hospitalâ€™s mortality rate with the national average, accounting for the types of patients cared for. HSMR is calculated as the ratio of the actual number of deaths to the expected number of deaths, multiplied by 100. It has been used by many hospitals worldwide to assess and analyze mortality rates and to identify areas for improvement.
